/*
Step 1: Write a function that outputs a student with their grades, where a student should be output with first name, last name, age, and a list of grades.


    Highlight the output of the first and last names, age, and grades with a line of 30x "=".
    Example:


Anton Meier (17)
==============================
Grades: 1,4,3,1,3,2,1,2


Step 2: Allow strings and numbers as grades
Task:


    Ensure that besides grades as numbers (German system), values A to F (American system) are also supported as grades. The function should output the student's grades.


Example:


    Anton Meier (17)
==============================

Noten:
A,2,F,3,1,B,2,5


Step 3: Allow undefined as a value (displayed as *)
Task:


    Ensure that "undefined" is now supported as a value in the grades. The function should output the student's grades and represent "undefined" as "*". (For example, if the student was absent and not graded).


Example:


    Anton Meier (17)
===========================

Noten:
A,2,*,3,1,B,*,5


Step 4: Print a list of all students in the console
Task:


    Write a function that prints a list of all students in the console.


    Example:


Anton Meier (16)
===========================
Grades: 1,4,3,1,A,*,1,2

Berta MÃ¼ller (17)
===========================
Grades: A,*,1
